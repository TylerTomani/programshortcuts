    <h1>Path To Becoming a SQL Python Programmer</h1>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp; On Jan 4th 2023 I began the <i>SQL Essential Training </i> course by <sub>Bill Weinman</sub> on linkedin learning,
        My subscription from last year ended so I began a One month free trail period on linkedin learning, 
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;I refuse to pay for anything else to learn, I will take advantage of linkein learning for this month, 
        and begin learning soley from free sources available online.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week I am focusing on these two tutorials, SQL Essential Training <sub>Bill Weinman</sub>
        and Python Essential Training <sub>Ryan Mitchell</sub>
